# Employee Tracker

Overview: 
In this project I created a content management systems (CMS).  This  interface allows non-developers to easily view and interact with information stored in databases. Through a command-line in the terminal, you can  choose options on how to manage a company's employee database, using Node.js, Inquirer, and MySQL.
